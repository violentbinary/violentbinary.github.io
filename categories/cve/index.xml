            </div>Unicorn Engine is cut from QEMU, it can be said to be a branch of QEMU, but it is a completely independent project. Unicorn provides a wealth of APIs, allowing us to easily experience many features brought by QEMU virtualization technology, but it also faces some security issues. We take the analysis of CVE-2022-XXXX as an example to briefly outline the principle of Unicorn memory virtualization. Only some simple analysis is made here, so that everyone can quickly grasp the whole picture of QEMU virtualization.]]></description>
